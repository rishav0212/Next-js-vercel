    description: `Iron oral spray is an effective intra-spray technology formulated to
                  directly deliver iron into the bloodstream, bypassing the primary
                  processing by the digestive system and thus preventing digestive
                  discomfort experienced from ingested iron supplements while also
                  enhancing bioavailability. The tiny droplets absorb quickly, providing
                  fast nutrient uptake.`,
