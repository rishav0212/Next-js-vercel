                            The Indian Pharma Expo 2013 took place on 20- 21 sept at Pragati Maidan in New Delhi. It was a unique pharma event, which proved to be the perfect platform flooded with opportunities for pharma entrepreneurs such as Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Ethical, PCD and Generic companies, eager to explore distributorship, franchisee & Third Party Manufacturing for their brands. Many Pharma students, doctors and consultants also visited the Exhibition and gained good exposure of Indian Pharma Industry.
