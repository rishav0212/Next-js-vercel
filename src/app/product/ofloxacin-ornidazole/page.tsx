            <b>Ofloxacin:</b>
            <br />
            Ofloxacin is a quinolone antibiotic used for treating certain kinds
            of bacterial infections(ear infections, urinary tract infections)
            and also useful in pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). It belongs to
            the fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics. Ofloxacin stops the
            multiplication of bacteria by inhibiting the reproduction and repair
            of their genetic material (DNA).

            <b>Ornidazole:</b>
            <br />
            Ornidazole is a nitroimidazole which is an antibacterial and
            antiprotozoal drug used to treat anaerobic enteric protozoa. It is a
            drug that cures some protozoan infections like (Giardiasis,
            Trichomoniasis). This antibacterial agent effective against a wide
            variety of gram-negative and gram-positive aerobic bacteria.

              It has been demonstrated by recent studies concomitant

              (Ornidazole), shows better symptoms relief compared with the
              modest improvement of infections with each of the treatments.

            <b>Ornidazole:</b>
            <br />
            The antimicrobial activity of ornidazole is due to the reduction of
            the nitro group to a more reactive amine that attacks microbial DNA,
            brings about loss of helical structure of DNA and subsequent DNA
            breakage thus inhibiting further synthesis and causing degradation
            of existing DNA.

            This suspension is the combination of Ofloxacin and ornidazole and
            has unique dual mode of action i.e., in the combination, ofloxacin
            may increase the anticoagulant effect of acenocoumarol and
            anisindione. Calcium salts such as calcium acetate may decrease the
            absorption of quinolone antibiotics such as ofloxacin. Of concern
            only with oral administration of both agents. Potentiates effect of
            coumarin-type oral anticoagulants.prolongs the muscle-relaxant
            effect of vacuronium bromide.
