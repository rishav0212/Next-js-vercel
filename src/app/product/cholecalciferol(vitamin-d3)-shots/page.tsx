            DESCRIPTION
          </Typography>

          <Typography sx={styles.sectionData} textAlign="justify">
            Cholecalciferol is also known as Vitamin D3. Vitamin D3 is a form of
            Vitamin D. Cholecalciferol is the raw form of the nutrient that
            humans obtain through exposure to sunlight. It is the form the
            nutrient takes after it has been processed for use by the body.
            Cholecalciferol is made in the skin following UVB light exposure It
            is structurally similar to steroids such as testosterone,
            cholesterol, and cortisol (though vitamin D3 itself is a
            secosteroid). Excessive doses in humans can result in vomiting,
            constipation, weakness, and confusion Vitamin D is an essential
            nutrient that plays an important role in calcium metabolism and bone
            health. In recent years, biomarkers like PTH, calcium absorption
            have been used to define relevant biological indices of vitamin D
            nutritional status. Vitamin D3 supports calcium in your body in
            order to develop and maintain strong bones and healthy teeth.
            <br />
            It is also found in some foods and can be taken as a dietary
            supplement. It is used to treat and prevent vitamin D deficiency and
            associated diseases, including rickets.

            Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol) is indicated in the treatment and
            prevention of bone disorders including osteomalacia, rickets and so
            on, which are caused by low levels of vitamin D in the body.It is
            also used for familial hypophosphatemia, hypoparathyroidism that is
            causing low blood calcium, and Fanconi syndrome.

            Mechanism
          </Typography>
          <Typography sx={styles.sectionData} textAlign="justify">
            Cholecalciferol is inactive by itself. It is converted to its active
            form by two hydroxylations: the first in the liver, by CYP2R1 or
            CYP27A1, to form 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (calcifediol, 25-OH
            vitamin D3). The second hydroxylation occurs mainly in the kidney
            through the action of CYP27B1 to convert 25-OH vitamin D3 into
            1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. All these metabolites are bound in
            blood to the vitamin D-binding protein. The action of calcitriol is
            mediated by the vitamin D receptor, a nuclear receptor which
            regulates the synthesis of hundreds of proteins and is present in
            virtually every cell in the body.

            Pharmacodynamics
          </Typography>
          <Typography textAlign="justify" sx={styles.sectionData}>
            Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) is a steroid hormone that has long been
            known for its important role in regulating body levels of calcium
            and phosphorus, in mineralization of bone, and for the assimilation
            of Vitamin A. The classical manifestations of vitamin D deficiency
            are rickets, which is seen in children and results in bony
            deformaties including bowed long bones. Deficiency in adults leads
            to the disease osteomalacia. Both rickets and osteomalacia reflect
            impaired mineralization of newly synthesized bone matrix, and
            usually result from a combination of inadequate exposure to sunlight
            and decreased dietary intake of vitamin D. Common causes of vitamin
            D deficiency include genetic defects in the vitamin D receptor,
            severe liver or kidney disease, and insufficient exposure to
            sunlight. Vitamin D plays an important role in maintaining calcium
            balance and in the regulation of parathyroid hormone (PTH). It
            promotes renal reabsorption of calcium, increases intestinal
            absorption of calcium and phosphorus, and increases calcium and
            phosphorus mobilization from bone to plasma.

            <b>ABSORPTION:</b> Cholecalciferol is readily absorbed from the
            small intestine if fat absorption is normal . Bile is necessary for
            absorption as well.
            <br />
            <b>PROTEIN BINDING:</b> 50% to 80%, in the plasma, vitamin D3 (from
            either diet or the skin) is bound to vitamin D-binding protein (DBP)
            produced in the liver, for transport to the liver.
            <br />
            <b>METABOLISM:</b> Within the liver, cholecalciferal is hydroxylated
            to calcidiol (25-hydroxycholecalciferol) by the enzyme
            25-hydroxylase. Within the kidney, calcidiol serves as a substrate
            for 1-alpha-hydroxylase, yielding calcitriol (1,
            25-dihydroxycholecalciferol), the biologically active form of
            vitamin D3.
            <br />
            <b>ELIMINATION:</b> Vitamin D is excreted in faeces and urine.
