              <b> Absorption: </b>
              Following oral administration in humans, azithromycin is widely
              distributed throughout the body bioavailability is approximately
              37%. The time taken to peak plasma levels is 2-3 hours.
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>Distribution: </b>
              Pharmacokinetic studies in humans have shown markedly higher
              azithromycin levels in tissue than in plasma (up to 50 times the
              maximum observed concentration in plasma) indicating that the drug
              is heavily tissue bound. Concentrations in target tissues, such as
              lung, tonsil and prostate exceed the MIC90 for likely pathogens
              after a single dose.
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>Elimination: </b>
              Plasma terminal elimination half-life closely reflects the tissue
              depletion half-life of 2 to 4 days. Approximately 12% of an
              intravenously administered dose is excreted in the urine over 3
              days as the parent drug, the majority in the first 24 hours.
              Biliary excretion of azithromycin is a major route of elimination
              for unchanged drug following oral administration. Very high
              concentrations of unchanged drug have been found in human bile,
              together with 10 metabolites, formed by Nand O-demethylation, by
              hydroxylation of the desosamine and aglycone rings, and by
              cleavage of the cladinose conjugate. Comparison of HPLC and
              microbiological assays in tissues suggests that metabolites play
              no part in the microbiological activity of azithromycin.
