            Azithromycin binds to the 50S subunit of the 70S bacterial

            <b> Absorption: </b>
            Following oral administration in humans, azithromycin is widely
            distributed throughout the body bioavailability is approximately
            37%. The time taken to peak plasma levels is 2-3 hours.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Distribution: </b>
            Pharmacokinetic studies in humans have shown markedly higher
            azithromycin levels in tissue than in plasma (up to 50 times the
            maximum observed concentration in plasma) indicating that the drug
            is heavily tissue bound. Concentrations in target tissues, such as
            lung, tonsil and prostate exceed the MIC90 for likely pathogens
            after a single dose.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Elimination: </b>
            Plasma terminal elimination half-life closely reflects the tissue
            depletion half-life of 2 to 4 days. Approximately 12% of an
            intravenously administered dose is excreted in the urine over 3 days
            as the parent drug, the majority in the first 24 hours. Biliary
            excretion of azithromycin is a major route of elimination for
            unchanged drug following oral administration. Very high
            concentrations of unchanged drug have been found in human bile,
            together with 10 metabolites, formed by Nand O-demethylation, by
            hydroxylation of the desosamine and aglycone rings, and by cleavage
            of the cladinose conjugate. Comparison of HPLC and microbiological
            assays in tissues suggests that metabolites play no part in the
            microbiological activity of azithromycin.
